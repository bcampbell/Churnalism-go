		Text: `By stimulating one part of the brain with laser light, researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center at UC San Francisco (UCSF) have shown that they can wipe away addictive behavior in rats – or conversely turn non-addicted rats into compulsive cocaine seekers.
"When we turn on a laser light in the prelimbic region of the prefrontal cortex, the compulsive cocaine seeking is gone," said Antonello Bonci, MD, scientific director of the intramural research program at the NIH's National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), where the work was done. Bonci is also an adjunct professor of neurology at UCSF and an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University.
Described this week in the journal Nature, the new study demonstrates the central role the prefrontal cortex plays in compulsive cocaine addiction. It also suggests a new therapy that could be tested immediately in humans, Bonci said.
Any new human therapy would not be based on using lasers, but would most likely rely on electromagnetic stimulation outside the scalp, in particular a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Clinical trials are now being designed to test whether this approach works, Bonci added.
The High Cost of Cocaine Abuse
Cocaine abuse is a major public health problem in the United States today, and it places a heavy toll on society in terms of lost job productivity, lost earnings, cocaine-related crime, incarcerations, investigations, and treatment and prevention programs."`,

		Text: `Human remains uncovered by University of Leicester-led archaeological search reveal circumstantial evidence consistent with battle wounds –but not in keeping with the Tudor sources that portrayed the warrior king as a wicked hunchback
Historic findings of human remains- including a man with apparent battle wounds and curvature of the spine - have been revealed by an archaeological team from the University of Leicester.
The University of Leicester has been leading the archaeological search for the burial place of King Richard III with Leicester City Council, in association with the Richard III Society. The dig, now in its third week, has yielded dramatic findings of human remains which the University will now subject to rigorous laboratory tests.
The stunning findings of human remains excavated by the archaeologists came from the Choir of the Grey Friars Church.
Richard Taylor, Director of Corporate Affairs at the University and one of the prime movers behind the project, said:
"The University of Leicester applied to the Ministry of Justice under the 1857 Burials Act for permission to exhume human remains found at the Grey Friars site in Leicester.`,

		Text: `A vast painting of volcanic catastrophe by the British artist John Martin (1789–1854) is to be exhibited for the first time in almost a century. When the Thames flooded in 1928, The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum 1821 was widely considered to have been destroyed. After a painstaking restoration, it will be unveiled to the public on 21 September 2011 as part of Tate Britain’s major exhibition, John Martin: Apocalypse.
John Martin (1789–1854) was a key figure in the nineteenth-century art world, renowned for his dramatic scenes of apocalyptic destruction and biblical catastrophe. One of John Martin’s most ambitious works, this large oil painting depicts the devastating eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD with survivors fleeing the destruction of the Roman cities Pompeii and Herculaneum. Measuring over eight feet across, it was the centrepiece of Martin’s 1822 solo exhibition at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, where advertisements described it as “the most extraordinary production of the pencil that has ever appeared in this or any other country”. Originally commissioned by the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, it was later sold by an art dealer to the National Gallery. It was transferred to Tate in 1918, by which time Martin’s reputation had declined substantially, and remained in storage until a severe Thames flood in 1928 badly damaged the painting and its remains were considered irreparable.`,
